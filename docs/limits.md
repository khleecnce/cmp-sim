# What this model cannot do

`docs/open-questions.md` lists things that are **undecided** and waiting on the
owner. This page lists the opposite: questions that have been **settled**, where
the answer is that the model declines to predict something, and the decision is
final until a specific named experiment arrives.

Each entry gives the measurement that establishes the limit, the refit that was
rejected and what it would have cost, and the experiment that would resolve it.
None of these is a TODO. A future session that "fixes" one without the named
measurement is reintroducing an error that was removed deliberately.

Every limit here is enforced by a test, so it cannot be quietly undone.

## 1. The velocity exponent is not fitted, because the corpus cannot resolve it

**The measurement.** Fitting `RR ∝ V^n` independently on each velocity-isolated
group gives exponents scattered from **−0.42 to 1.10**, straddling the Preston
value of 1.0. The negative case is not noise: it is the documented low-pressure
regime of US 6,918,821 B2, where the measured rate collapses as speed rises.
Checking whether the exponent varies systematically with pressure gives
**opposite trends in the two datasets that allow the test**.

**The refit rejected.** Any single global exponent. With the in-scope values
spanning both sides of 1.0, a fitted mean would be a number with no support in
either regime.

**What would resolve it.** A velocity sweep repeated at three or more down forces
on one tool and one consumable set, so that the pressure dependence of the
exponent is measured rather than inferred across labs.

## 2. The lubrication gate would be *wrong*, not merely uncalibrated

**The measurement.** The obvious explanation for the velocity inversion is a
transition into hydrodynamic lubrication, and `core/regime.py` already computes
λ. The inverting rows really are the highest-λ rows (0.187 against 0.070), and λ
correlates with over-prediction (ρ = −0.71 and −0.52 on the two datasets).

But λ turns out to be **exactly proportional to V/p** — it *is* the
pseudo-Sommerfeld number, carrying no information beyond the two variables
already in Preston's law. And the λ intervals of the inverting and
non-inverting rows **overlap**, so no threshold separates them.

**The refit rejected.** Rescaling λ so that the inverting rows cross a boundary.
This was the plan of an earlier commit in this project, which the next commit
corrected: because the intervals overlap, *no* calibration can work. The gate
would fire on rows that do not invert.

**What would resolve it.** A direct film-thickness measurement (e.g. dual-emission
UV fluorescence) on the conditions that invert, giving λ independently of V/p.

**Enforced by** `tests/test_lubrication_gate_is_wrong_not_premature.py`.

## 3. Pad contact does not separate the inversion either

**The measurement.** With fluid film excluded, pad contact is the next candidate.
`summit_saturation` appears to separate the cases cleanly — 0.0111 on the
inverting rows against 0.0296 — but it equals **0.00739 × P** exactly: it is
pressure relabelled, with the same pad in both datasets, and carries no
independent information. `plasticity_index` and `pad_limited_plasticity_lambda`
differ *between* datasets (0.0219 against 0.0029) but are **constant within**
each one, so they are fixed by the consumable set and cannot vary with the recipe
rows that invert.

**The refit rejected.** A contact-based gate. It would be pressure under another
name, and the inversion is not a function of pressure alone.

**What would resolve it.** Asperity statistics measured on the specific pads used,
rather than inherited pad-class constants.

**Enforced by** `tests/test_contact_metrics_do_not_separate_the_inversion.py`.

## 4. The oxidiser term's sign flips with pressure, and the coupling is not fitted

**The measurement.** The Cu oxidiser sweeps disagree: ihnfeldt2008 peaks near
0.1 wt%, jani2025 is still rising at 6 wt%, and US 8,501,625 B2 contains **both
signs**. The hypothesis that the sign tracks BTA presence is falsified — that
patent shows both signs at the same 0.08 mM BTA.

What separates them is **down force**. Two groups identical in every slurry
variable (0.17 wt% abrasive, 0.0078 M citric acid, 0.08 mM BTA, no oxalic acid,
200 ml/min, pH 3.6, 93 rpm) differ only in pressure:

    2 psi:  8200 → 7200 → 6300    monotone falling
    1 psi:  1900 → 3900 → 3300    rising, peak near 9 wt%

This is mechanistically sensible — H₂O₂ grows a passivating film, and whether more
film helps or hurts depends on whether the mechanics can clear it, which is why
the falling group is also the higher-rate one.

**The refit rejected.** Moving `oxidizer_peak_wt_pct` up to fit
`jani2025_cu_rsm_composition_heldout`, whose 51.2% error is caused by this. It
would break ihnfeldt2008 and the 2 psi group of US 8,501,625 B2. Two pressures
from one patent cannot fit a coupling.

**Confound that cannot be separated.** The peak's citation (GT07, 2–3.6 wt%) is
for an **alumina**/glycine slurry while jani2025 is silica. Abrasive type and
pressure co-vary across these datasets.

**What would resolve it.** One H₂O₂ sweep repeated at three or more down forces
with everything else fixed.

## 5. Ceria's pH response is not unimodal, and `ph_response` is

**The measurement.** `netzband2020` measures a **valley**: 198 / 113 / 200 / 213
Å/min at pH 4 / 6 / 8 / 10. Netzband attributes it to two isoelectric points —
the oxide's (pH 2–3) and ceria's (~8) — with pH 6 optimal for neither.
`ph_response` is a single bell: between its ends it can rise-then-fall but never
fall-then-rise, so no parameter choice produces a valley. The 49.2% error is
structural.

Note what this is *not*. The experiment is a 2.25 cm² benchtop coupon, so absolute
rates are ~8× out — but the reported error is already scale-free (best common
scale k = 0.128 leaves exactly 49.2%), so the tool mismatch costs nothing. And
every point is inside the pack's declared pH range.

**The refit rejected.** A netzband-only fit reaches **15.0%** at peak 8.50, width
0.75, floor 0.95, acid_floor 0.70 — by making the pH response nearly flat, which
suits a dataset spanning only 1.9×. The same constants score **492.6%** on
dandu2009, the nine-point sweep they were fitted to, which swings 81×. The two
datasets demand opposite functional forms.

**What would resolve it.** A second pH channel keyed to the abrasive's isoelectric
point. Note a *universal* second channel was already tested and **falsified** —
the three pH residuals in this corpus have three different shapes — so this would
have to be a per-pack channel justified by more than one benchtop dataset.

## 6. Where a bounded peak has no measured side, the answer is a refusal

**The measurement.** Three packs pin `ph_peak` to the lowest pH their source table
contains, because free fitting wanted an optimum at a pH nobody polished at. The
consequence is that one side of the bell is unmeasured, and `ph_acid_mechanical_floor`
is often 0 because there is no measured acid limb to floor. The model then decays
to **0.00 Å/min**, with no warning from the existing "2.5 widths from the optimum"
check (at pH 1.0 the distance is only 2.0 widths).

**The decision.** Each pack declares `ph_valid_range` — the span of the experiment
its constants were fitted to, never the union of every dataset that uses the pack
— and the engine warns outside it, naming the floor and stating that a **zero**
floor makes the result a refusal rather than a number.

**Deliberately *not* a gate.** Splitting the corpus by range membership gives
in-range median 18.9% (n=19) against out-of-range 19.4% (n=11), Mann-Whitney
**z = −0.15**. Out-of-range prediction is not measurably worse, and the group
contains some of the best results in the corpus (bouvet2002_w 2.3%). A gate is for
*"this prediction would be wrong"*, not for *"this prediction rests on fewer
measurements"*.

## 7. Some datasets cannot be predicted better than they were measured

**The measurement.** `hong2007` contains three rows identical in every override,
reporting **2650 / 2400 / 1850 Å/min** — 13.0% mean absolute deviation. No model
can score better than that on this dataset. The model's 14.8% is at the floor,
and it *ties* the flat baseline rather than losing to it (both are 14.8%; a
previously recorded 12.6% was stale).

Corpus-wide, three datasets sit at or below their own replicate scatter:

| dataset | replicate scatter | shape error |
|---|---:|---:|
| `sic2026_ceria_h2o2_ph_DOE50` | 38.5% | 34.0% |
| `us9200180b2_cu_benzenesulfonic_series` | 24.6% | 26.8% |
| `hong2007_cu_ads_bta_polish_rate` | 13.0% | 14.8% |

**The refit rejected.** Any further fitting on these three. The SiC entry is the
instructive one: its 34.0% was treated as a weakness all session and is in fact
better than the set's own reproducibility.

⚠ Only 5 datasets have genuine replicates. For the rest the noise floor is
**unknown**, which is a limit of the evidence and not a licence to assume it is
zero. The blank `repl%` column in `cmp-sim accuracy` covers *three* different
states, and collapsing them into "no noise here" is the mistake this entry
guards against:

* the rates **are** averages and the source withholds the spread — the floor is
  real and unrecoverable (`du2004` says so explicitly of its five-run averages);
* the rates were **digitized from a figure** with the read error stated — a
  *transcription* floor (`bouvet2002_w` ~1.0% of typical rate, `bouvet2002_ti`
  ~2.7%);
* nothing is stated at all.

The transcription floors earn the column: `bouvet2002_w` scores 2.3% against a
1.0% floor and is effectively finished, while `bouvet2002_ti` scores 30.7%
against 2.7% and is a genuine unexplained miss. Without the floors both read as
"one good number, one bad number".

**What would resolve it.** Replicate runs at a handful of conditions per
dataset — three repeats of one condition is enough to bound the floor. This is
the cheapest missing experiment in the whole corpus and would tell us how much of
the remaining 19.5% median is even addressable.

## 8. A null result is not an omission, and silence must be sourced

**The measurement.** `w_fe_oxidizer` declares no pH response while its own dataset
sweeps pH. That pattern is exactly how a missing term hides: in
`cu_alkaline_benzenesulfonic`, a missing pH response had its work absorbed by the
oxidiser term, whose shape constant was then justified by what was really pH drift.

Here the silence is correct. US 2011/0186542 A1 runs a two-level pH control at
matched oxidiser and abrasive — six matched pairs, mean ratio **0.958** with an
**inconsistent sign** (more acid raises the rate in one pair, lowers it in five),
against an 8× oxidiser effect in the same table.

**The decision.** The null result is declared in the pack with its table and its
scope (pH 3–6 only — nothing licenses an alkaline W slurry), registered in the
audit, and **re-derived by the test** from the six pairs rather than trusted.

**What would resolve it** — i.e. what would turn the silence back into a term: a
W pH sweep outside 3–6, particularly alkaline, at fixed oxidiser. The current null
is a statement about pH 3–6 and nothing wider; outside that window the honest
behaviour is to decline rather than to extrapolate a flat response.

## 9. Titanium is an unsupported film, and one figure cannot make it supported

**The measurement.** `bouvet2002_ti_silica_size_sweep` is the corpus's largest
miss relative to its own floor: **30.7%** shape error against a ~2.7%
digitisation floor, on the size axis — otherwise the model's best (11.2%).

Three files come from the same paper, the same figure, the same slurry family and
the same tool. Only the film differs, and the three films disagree completely
about what particle size does:

| d50 (nm) | Ti | W | oxide |
|---|---|---|---|
| 12 | 2055 | 3097 | 1355 |
| 25 | 1840 | 2975 | 1875 |
| 45 | 1141 | 2743 | 1564 |
| 75 | 946 | 2893 | 1402 |

Empirical size exponent: **Ti −0.454, W −0.049, oxide +0.001**. All three are
scored with `pack: oxide_silica`, whose `abrasive_size_exponent` is **−0.05** —
W's value to two decimals. The pack is right for W (2.3%) and oxide (11.2%) and
wrong for Ti, and that one mismatched exponent is the entire 30.7%.

**The refit that was rejected.** Fitting a Ti exponent of −0.45. It would have
taken the error to near zero — and told us nothing. These four points are the
**only** titanium data in the corpus, so the constant would be tested on exactly
the data it was fitted to. The data is also weaker than the clean trend suggests:
as a pure power law Ti gives R² = 0.89 with a −13.9% residual at 25 nm, on four
*digitised* points.

**What would resolve it.** A second, independent Ti size sweep from a different
group, with a printed rate table rather than a figure. Two datasets make a fitted
exponent testable; one makes it self-validating.

The dataset already declares `film: other` and flags its pack as a placeholder
for shape/rank use only. The miss stays **visible** in the score rather than
being excluded — an unsupported film that quietly disappears from the report is
worse than a 30.7% a reader can see and interrogate.

## 10. A pack can look complete and be evidenced in one axis only

**The measurement.** `oxide_silica_anionic` and `oxide_silica_aminosilane` are
the two least-evidenced packs in the corpus (11% and 16% of their parameters
exercised by any dataset). Both are silica-on-oxide variants carrying a different
pH optimum. Diffing each against its parent `oxide_silica`:

| variant | parameters differing | all pH? |
|---|---|---|
| `oxide_silica_anionic` | 6 of 124 | yes |
| `oxide_silica_aminosilane` | 7 of 125 | yes |

Every other constant — Preston coefficient, pad mechanics, abrasive exponents,
conditioning, pattern terms — is inherited unchanged.

**The refit that was rejected.** Merging the variants back into the parent, which
would have removed two thinly-evidenced files. Re-scoring each variant's dataset
with the parent pack instead:

    cn109609035b_oxide_anionic_silica_ph    32.1%  ->   94.7%   (+62.5 points)
    us9422456b2_teos_silica_ph_pressure     25.3%  ->  126.6%  (+101.3 points)

The splits are decisively justified — one bell centred at pH 11 cannot also serve
pH 2 and pH 4.9 — so the packs stay.

**The limit.** They are justified *in pH and nothing else*. A reader opening a
62-parameter variant file could reasonably conclude that an anionic-silica slurry
had been characterised independently; it has been characterised in pH, on seven
rows, and borrows the rest. That is what inheritance is for, but the failure mode
is silent because the pack looks complete. Each pack now says so in its own
header.

**What would resolve it.** Any dataset for these slurry systems that sweeps a
non-pH axis — pressure, abrasive size or loading — would turn inherited constants
into evidenced ones. Today there is not one.

## 11. A good shape error does not mean a good rate

**The measurement.** Shape error (how well the model ranks conditions) and scale
error (whether the absolute rate is right) fail independently. The corpus median
shape error is 19.5%, but of the 34 datasets whose sources permit absolute
comparison, **13 are off by more than 3×**:

| dataset | shape | measured ÷ predicted |
|---|---:|---:|
| `ep3161098b1_teos_silica_pressure_sweep` | **7.1%** | **139.2×** |
| `liang2026_4hsic_ceria_composite_h2o2_conc` | 20.6% | 92.0× |
| `bouvet2002_w_silica_size_sweep` | **2.3%** | 75.6× |
| `bouvet2002_oxide_silica_size_sweep` | 11.2% | 39.2× |
| `us6918821b2_cu_ic1000_pressure_speed_2x3` | 44.1% | 0.08× (over-predicts 12×) |

The first and third rows are the point: near-perfect *trends* on rates that are
wrong by one to two orders of magnitude.

**The refit that was rejected.** Re-anchoring each pack's `Kp` so its datasets
land near 1.0×. Rejected because the deficit is not in `Kp`: the packs that
*inherit* `Kp` unchanged are among the best calibrated (0.51×, 2.04×) while the
worst offender is their parent, and its gap tracks pH distance from the fitted
peak — inside `oxide_silica`'s range [10.0, 12.5] the same pack scores 0.60× and
0.85×, at pH 3–4.7 it scores 39×, 98×, 139×. Refitting `Kp` would bake an
extrapolation error into a constant that is currently correct.

**The limit.** A 19.5% median is a **ranking** claim. It supports "which
direction does this knob move the rate, and roughly how much"; it does not
support "this slurry removes 2,400 Å/min". Absolute rate depends on tool, pad
break-in and consumable lot, none of which the literature reports consistently.

**What would resolve it.** One calibration wafer on the user's own tool: a single
measured rate at a known P·V re-anchors `Kp` for that pack and turns the ranking
claim into a rate claim. That is a one-experiment fix, and it is per-tool by
nature — no corpus can do it in advance.
